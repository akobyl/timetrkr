## � Philosophy

TimeTrkr was built not just with code, but with vibes. Every feature request was met with "yeah, we can totally do that!" Energy flows where attention goes, and we put our attention into making time tracking suck less.

No elaborate planning documents or complex requirement specs - just collaborative, iterative development guided by what felt right. We call it "vibe coding" - where intuition meets implementation.

Now with the power of modern Vue.js components, we've elevated the vibe to new heights - making the codebase as organized as your time will be.

## Why TimeTrkr?

Because spreadsheets are boring, expensive time trackers are annoying, and writing hours on sticky notes is just asking for trouble.

## Disclaimer

TimeTrkr may cause unexpected productivity insights, reduced end-of-month billing panic, and occasional moments of "wow, I spent THAT much time on meetings?"
