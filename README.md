## Welcome to the Vibe Coded Time Tracking Revolution! ¿

TimeTrkr is a lightweight, easy-to-use time tracking app built on positive energy, good vibes, and occasionally questionable late-night coding sessions. Perfect for freelancers, remote workers, or anyone who keeps saying "I'll just track my hours later" (we know you won't).

## ¿ Features That Spark Joy

- **Today's Time**: See what you've accomplished today (or what you claim to have accomplished)
- **Week Time**: Break down your entire week with daily totals - perfect for realizing where your time actually went
- **All Entries**: Review, edit, or delete your entire time tracking history (we won't judge)
- **Time Selectors with Increments**: Easily adjust time with +/- 5 or 15 minute buttons because who actually starts work exactly at 9:00 AM?
- **Persistent Login**: We remember you for 7 days because life's too short for constant logins
- **Auto-refresh**: Your entries update automatically - one less button to click!

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js, Bootstrap, Axios
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite
- **Secret Ingredients**: Enthusiasm, multiple debugging sessions, and copious amounts of caffeine

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the server: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
4. Track time like a boss

## Usage Insights

- The "Now" button is your friend - it sets the current time (rounded to the nearest 15 min)
- Daily totals in the Week view help you understand your productivity patterns
- Use the month filter in All Entries to avoid endless scrolling through your work history

## ¿ Philosophy

TimeTrkr was built not just with code, but with vibes. Every feature request was met with "yeah, we can totally do that!" Energy flows where attention goes, and we put our attention into making time tracking suck less.

No elaborate planning documents or complex requirement specs - just collaborative, iterative development guided by what felt right. We call it "vibe coding" - where intuition meets implementation.

## Why TimeTrkr?

Because spreadsheets are boring, expensive time trackers are annoying, and writing hours on sticky notes is just asking for trouble.

## Disclaimer

TimeTrkr may cause unexpected productivity insights, reduced end-of-month billing panic, and occasional moments of "wow, I spent THAT much time on meetings?"
